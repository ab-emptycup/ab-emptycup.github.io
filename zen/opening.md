Trying to develop an opening routine for daily work.
Not clear what it will be and why. Will have to figure it out as I go.
For now, the expectation is that it should:

- Help recollect the big picture
- Make sure I'm focusing on the high leverage tasks
- Offer the freedom to forget the big picture and go deep
- Act as a safety switch to avoid falling into reactive work.


So far:

- Review CEO.xmind.
- Revisit Todo to update chores & tasks.
- Review calendar for any commitments / meetings.
- Setup quick notes for the day to not miss any insights / connections.
- Publish the previous day's log and start today's.

This looks like mundane stuff, but I should make this ritual automatics. Let's start with 21.
