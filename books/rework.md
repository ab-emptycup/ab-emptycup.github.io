### The insights that I especially liked are:

1. Decisions are temporary. Keep making tiny decisions.
2. Throw less at the problem. Underdo your competition. You need less than you think.
3. Long lists don't get done.
4. Hire great writers.
5. Out teach your competition.
6. Don't write it down. User feedback can, will & should stay on top of your mind.
7. Say no by default. No is no to one thing. Yes is no to many things.
8. Send people home at 5.
9. Don't scar on the first cut.
10. Be at-home good.
11. Sell your by-products.
