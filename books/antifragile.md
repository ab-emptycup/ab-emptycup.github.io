**Introduction:**

- Antidote for [black swans](/books/blackswan/).
- Antifragility is measureable.
- Curiously antagonistic to intellectual design.
- Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of other's fragility.
- Fragilistas are everywhere.
- Fragility hates volitility. Antifragility loves it.
- The disorder family: variability, stressor, uncertainity, dispersion of outcomes.
- Overcompensation leads to antifragility.
- Antifragile systems atrophy in the absense of stressors.
- Obesessive love is the most antifragile thing outside economics.
- Information is antifragile. Secrets spread like wildfire.

**Evolution:**

- Engineered is fragile. Organic is antifragile.
- Antifragility can come from layers.
- Competition among units in one layer leads to antifragility of the higher layer.
- Proteins < Cells < Organisms < Species < Ecosystem < Nature
- Aggregate's interests are opposed to individual interests.
- What doesn't kill me kills others, making the aggregate stronger.
- Evolution benefits from randomness of mutation as well as environment.
- Nature's antifragility is within limits, but very high limits.
