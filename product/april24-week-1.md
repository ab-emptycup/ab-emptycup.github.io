title: Perfection vs Usage
---

### Week #1: April, 2024

This is a reflection on navigating the haze of GTM in an attempt to be conscious.

The product is almost ready. What that means specifically is that **most**
of the core functionality has been tested. I'm not sure how thorough that is though. There
may be a few less common, but important flows that are still buggy. I'm finding it hard to
personally test all the cases myself. The exercise is very damping and upsets my flow of
guiding product development. The context switch is hard.

I'm not sure, if I should push this to more users to increase the usage as I'm worried they
may run into "obvious" & already known issues when they delve into detailed design.
That discourages them from picking up the product again.

I did force some designers close to me, to use the product on trial. I have also offered free credits.
Every trial session seems to uncover a fresh batch of bugs & polish requests, though the severity and
volume of the issues has been coming down considerably with each session. The gap between these
iterations is around 1 week now.

- For the coming week, I already have a backlog of over 30 issues that are necessary fixes.
- I have over a dozen users who have committed to test the product who are waiting.
- Onboarding is still blocking because the tutorial videos only have 50% coverage.

The dilemma at this point for me is:

**Prioritize aggressively for blocking issues and push the product to users. I shouldn't worry about users becoming frustrated, they'll come back as we're solving a hard pain point. The more usage I have, the more confident I'll become of the product. Usage uncovers issues much much more efficiently than planning.**

_Don't get impatient. Don't be insecure. Don't worry about your self imposed deluded deadlines. If you push, you waste customer's time, damage your reputation and risk souring everyone's tempo and mood with mismanagement. Have patience. You have already waited more than a year. Another week or two won't make a big difference. Do everyone a favor and hold your horses. But don't let the focus on the product waver. Even if you get more usage, your development bandwidth for the next week is already committed. If you become impatient, your overall efficiency will also drop. Instead hold the product for a week or two more and then you can step out and not look back._

**Am I afraid to look bad? Do I have a fear of rejection? Am I letting my perfectionism getting in the way of growth? Is the artist blocking the businessman? Isn't this a slippery slope? I should be accountable.**

_Get over yourself. It is a bit rich to talk about prioritisation over a couple of weeks when you have deprioritised growth for 6 months already. Stop second guessing. Commit to the product. Focus on putting out the best version you can._

_This is a lesson you have already learnt. Being too eager for external validation botches the whole exercise, breaks your rhythm, puts the entire product development effort into a reactive mode. Instead, be more methodical. Keep winning users. Don't skip ahead. Remember the Toyota's practice of stopping the assembly line to fix quality issues._

**How can I accept this whole heartedly and commit without second guessing? What if this is a never ending pattern? Isn't perfection a dream?**

_No, perfection is not a dream. It is very much an aspiration and a core value. It represents the quality standard we want to stand for. Next time, when you reflect on what the identity of the company is, remember this. This is what it means to be committed to quality._

_Still, you can implement some safety nets if you're so unsure._

1. _Ask yourself the same question every week and reflect on this decision every week till you reach a convincing post mortem._
2. _Be very very critical of any scope creep till release. The goal at this stage is to simpilify, not add more._
