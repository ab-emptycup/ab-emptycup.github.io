title: Rainy reflection
---

An aimless reflection of a 3 week period in the monsoons.
There are a lot of things that I want to consider deeply.
 - A random sampling of my work load.
 - My drive over a considerable time chunk.
 - Understanding priorities at a higher resolution.
 - Compulsive need for busy productivity.
 - Loss of intensity in the middle phase of a sprint
 - Gaining elevation coming off of a minor trough.
 - Variation of energy levels with weather.
 - Challenges in building & managing an intense routine.
