Jan 22 - Jan 29<br>
Week#: 4/52<br>



### Hour 1:



---

Last week was good in terms of consistency, ok in terms of productivity, unfortunate in terms of output. I'm want to just
keep it up this week. There might be an off day on 26th. Accounting for that I'm aiming for 30 hours this week.

A few pointers from last week:

- May be I need to be more precise about time when logging work. But, not sure, if it is even so important.
- I should definitely use the timer more often and more effectively.

The tasks that I want to wrap up this week:

- __4 hours:__ Setting up rendering on [emptycup3d.com]()
- __4 hours:__ Fixing page scroll issue in ModularUI.
- __2 hours:__ Fixing small component move in ModularUI.
- __4 hours:__ Enable partition deletion.
- __12 hours:__ Fix textured materials.
- __28 hours:__ Fix studio3d issues:
    - __8 hours:__ Missing default materials for components.
    - __8 hours:__ Improper UV scale for walls in 360 renders.
    - __12 hours:__ Line shadow at 7' height


Planned for 54 hours. Available time is 30 hours. Fingers crossed.
