title: October Week 4
---

Just resetting the dev environment after a system factory reset.
I'll be focusing this week on hiring and getting the dev environment ready.
This process will also be about getting into a good working rhythm.
I'm not expecting there to be a lot of programming work as my focus is hiring.
But, I'm hoping to use this log as a support journal to drive the execution work
for hiring.

I've been making my way through the "forest". It has not been an efficient or steady
progress due to a lot of chaos. I did also spend a lot of time getting my bearings
and charting out a path. I'm hoping things will become a little more steady and progressive now.
