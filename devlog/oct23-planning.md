title: Planning - October'23
---

This thread is mainly for planning purposes. Hopefully, this will help me
reflect on execution strategy. I have very limited resources. So, making sure
I spend every hour on the most important and high leverage things is crucial.


I just have 3-4 days left in October. So, this will be good trial to see if 
the logging paradigm helps for this kind of work. Fingers crossed.


### Day 1: 

Originally, I wanted to handle hiring on priority and product development as secondary.
But, it looks like I'll have to deprioritise product completely considering my 
limited bandwidth and the short hiring window we have in November and december. 
So, that work will effectively be stalled for atleast another month. I had just 
gotten started a couple of days back. But, parallelly, I had also started the
hiring drive and it seems that itself will be a lot of work. So, in the interest of focus,
product work has been put on hold. That's decision #1 for today.


That cleared, the next step is to revisit the hiring strategy and derive today's agenda
from that.

I also am considering developing a repeatable daily SoP so that I don't have to spend 
a lot of focus on this daily regroup:

1. I can use my todo list to just go through my commitments and plan for the day.
2. I can use the worklog to support me through the actual work.
3. I can use my mind map to give me a bigger picture of my goals and strategies.
4. I can use sheets to review my position and progress.

Yet, there's something missing from this. I need something to ground me and establish context.
I could use my big picture mind map. But, that feel insufficient. Specifically, it is 
enlightening, but it doesn't bring a sense of action. After going through it, I still feel at
a loss where to begin.

I think what can help here is a SoP. Let me put this on the Todo list and get back to this.
