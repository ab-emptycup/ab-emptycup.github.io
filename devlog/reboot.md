title: Reboot
---


This is my attempt to reboot into a creative routine after a burn out. Not ready for a full post mortem of what caused the burnout yet. Realised I need to step up my game to meet the creative demands. One of the main causes for the burn out was not giving myself time to reflect & plan. This is an attempt to fix that. This model worked well for me with development. I'm a little lost actually. I'm not sure what I'm trying to do with this. So, I decided I'll just keep writing about it and see if that brings some clarity and hopefully some structure.

First, I put down our main objectives and the tasks/activities that they involve.
That seemed to have freed up some headspace for sure. But it still feels incomplete.

What is my next step?

_There are some high priority urgent but not important items that are still drawing my attention._
This is a recurring pattern. This is one of the major causes for my burn out.
So, I need to gate / timebox these demands. Fixed timeslots is a good starting point.
2-6 for all calls and chores is what I'm thinking.

Reset the todo list system and added all the tasks into it.
On the flipside, todo lists are what caused the burn out in the first place.
So, may be I'll reign that in a little bit.


I have the objectives mapped out.
I have the tasks mapped out.
Can I do a timeline?

I tried to do a timeline, but it felt like wish making. The tasks should be broken down to a more granular level.
Exploring Quire to see if it makes the timeline planning process easier.
Signed up and mapped the whole timeline on a Quire project.
Definitely easier to break things down and plan timelines. But, I feel like I'm losing prioritisation somehow.

_I still feel like, something's missing._

Maybe that's the way of the jungle. You don't get to have a beautiful big picture all the time.
So, I started prioritizing some of the tasks and setting deadlines.

At this point, I feel the biggest differentiator is streamlining lead generation.
For this, the key problem to solve is getting a good marketing agency onboard.
