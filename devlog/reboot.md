title: Reboot

This is my attempt to reboot into a creative routine after a burn out. Not ready for a full post mortem of what caused the burnout yet. Realised I need to step up my game to meet the creative demands. One of the main causes for the burn out was not giving myself time to reflect & plan. This is an attempt to fix that. This model worked well for me with development. I'm a little lost actually. I'm not sure what I'm trying to do with this. So, I decided I'll just keep writing about it and see if that brings some clarity and hopefully some structure.



First, I put down our main objectives and the tasks/activities that they involve.
That seemed to have freed up some headspace for sure. But it still feels incomplete.

What is my next step?

_There are some high priority urgent but not important items that are still drawing my attention._
This is a recurring pattern. This is one of the major causes for my burn out. So, I need to gate / timebox these demands.
Fixed timeslots is a good starting point. 2-6 for all calls and chores is what I'm thinking.
