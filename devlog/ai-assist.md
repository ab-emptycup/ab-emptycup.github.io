Rebooting on engineering to level up. Will do an hourly log without an agenda or an expectation.
Let's see how far this goes.
My focus for this log is level up our AI game for product development (mostly).

Here it goes...


### Hour 1:

- First I need to regroup on the status of the repo.
- Then clean up the environment (dead branches, stashes etc)
- Then I need to figure out what are the things that I need to work on.
- Then I will explore what I can do with AI get a leg up.

`compinit` zsh issue because of homebrew on multiple user accounts [Fixed]

Quotation functionality not working. Everything showing as zero.
- Looking into that. Will probably start refactoring & cleaning up implementation.
- The implementation is just Uhhh gleeee. 1300 lines in the page component. Feels like java.
- **Asked copilot to add console logs and boom I can follow execution in the browser console. Neat trick.**
- Tried resetting the quote with no lukc.

Next I want to first get it to work as expected before refactoring.
