Feb 19 - Feb 25<br>
Week #: 8/52<br>


### Wed, Feb 23

I pushed the v0.3 version to production already. There are some painful issues still:
    - Ceiling previews are now black
    - Untested completely

But, I feel like working on catalogues now. I just want to get that big thing out of the way first and then focus on the
small things. Catalogues is no joke and it is blocking because new users can't signup because of it even if they're willing
to put up with the bugs.

Here's what I have on my plate:

- First I need an analysis of all the exisiting furnishings.
- I also need a top down break up of the furnishing categories.
- I need to clean up the palettes, slots, furnitures code.
- I need to add the 'upload' flow for new components.
- I need to merge the UI for selecting furnishings in LayoutPlanner and ModularUI.
- I need to add facility to customise door models
- I need to add facility to customise handle models
- I need to organise materials
- Redo previews for all the furnishings and components.
