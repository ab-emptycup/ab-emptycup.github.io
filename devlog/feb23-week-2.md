Feb 12 - Feb 18<br>
Week #: 7/52<br>



Last week mostly went into UX trials and feedback. I'll focus on fixing the issues this week.
There are a few core issues to be resolved first. I'll aim to get standard workflow sorted by the end of the week.
I'll also try to create a simple video demo to introduct the UX.

The deal breaker issues to fix are:

1. Default woodworks not loading.
2. Cmd + Click for alternate selection
3. Move with room / lock room.
4. Workable render flow.

Apart from the fixes, I also have a few other things to work on this week:

1. 3min product demo video.
2. Merge PRs and create issues for Portfolio.
3. Follow up compliance paper work and initiate address change.
