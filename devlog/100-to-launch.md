title: 100 hours to launch
---

This is a 100 hour countdown to launch of [emptycup3d.com]().


### Hour 1:

I just refactored _Scene.js_ from _libscenejs_. Todo next:

- Debug and fix issues with refactored code
- Clean up and commit.
- Evaluate if the current model loading process is blocking.
- Start refactoring the _WalkinLoader.js_

Finished debugging. Works apart for model loading.


### Hour 2:

Next steps are:

- Remove the old _Walkin.js_ and commit.
- Clean up the _WalkinLoader.js_.

Done:

- Finished cleaning up the code. Committed.
- Reorganised the loaders into scenejs/loaders. Committed.
- Started rewriting / refactoring _WalkinLoader.js_ and it is, UGLY.


### Hour 3:

Cleaned up the overall flow of _WalkinLoader.js_. This is going to be a lot cleaner once the refactor is done.
I still need to refactor / rewrite the parsing and the loading code.

### Hour 4, 5:

Still working through _parseMaterial()_
