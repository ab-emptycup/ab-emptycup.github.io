Jan 29 - Feb 4<br>
Week#: 5/52<br>

### Hour 5:

Investor sync up call

### Hour 4:

Started debugging the issue with missing defaults for components in Studio 3D. Ran into issue with getting the dev environment to run.
Gave up unable to figure out the root cause. The API endpoint seems to be returning empty responses. API requests are not showing up in the logs.
The dev setup has become a huge pain with too many moving parts.

### Hour 3:

- Blocked for an investor call. Got rescheduled.
- Setup a product review call for coming wednesday.
- Started the monthly review of finances.

    - Fix modular UI scroll (4 hours)
    - Fix layout first load (4 hours)
    - Revamp the _svelte_ import pattern (4 hours)
    - Buffer to fix bugs (12 hours)

- Schedule calls:
    - Product onboarding call
    - UI/UX review call
    - Investor update call


### Hour 1: Last week review

- Reviewed GTD. Missing daily visits. That's why the routine is lacking oompf. But then the tasks are also low priority.
- Missing daily task tracker reviews. This needs to be addressed this week.
- Finished [devlog summary](/devlog/jan23-week-4)

Stretching the week a bit this time:

- 36 hours of dev work
- +4 hours of calls
- +10 hours on planning & creatives
- 50 hours of work in total

This is probably the maximum hours I can spare for work in a balanced schedule.

With regards to logging:

- I want to log non dev work also (devlog -> worklog)
- Maximum log chunk can't be for more than 2 hours. Preferrably, always 1.

Pitfalls to be mindful about:

- Don't leak hours during the first half. Especially @ 10-11am.
- Plan the afternoon's creative work a day in advance in the background.
- Pace myself. Don't get winded.
- Be prepared for a mid week motivation slump. Noticed this last week. Stop thinking. Just keep going.
