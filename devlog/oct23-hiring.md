title: Hiring - October'23
---

This log is commencing only in the last week of October 2023.

This is the highest priority work for this quarter. And, unfortunately,
this is the kind of work that I have a bad track record in. It's my hope
that I can getter at doing this by taking things slow and consistent.

Logging is an effort in that direction. Let's see how it goes.

This week will mainly be about preparation. Specifically:

1. I want to setup a scalable online evaluation process.
2. Reach out to the right colleges to evaluate their viability.
3. Get the collateral ready to present the company and the academy program to students.

This is high stakes work because we have already failed with hiring before and the hiring
window is just a month. If I waste time or don't move quickly and decisively, I may
end up not finding the right students. That will mean I'll have to work on the product
alone for the next one year.


### Day 1:

Here are the important things to get done today:

1. Find the student coordinators for recruitment on LinkedIn & reach out.
2. Create a doc explaining the take home assignment to students.
3. Create a doc explaining EmptyCup's academy program to share with students.
4. Review the JD and publish again.

So, lets get started.

First, I want to shortlist half a dozen colleges and add them to the hiring dashboard.
Then I want to go on LinkedIn, find the student recruitment coordinators and reach out.

Shortlisted IIITs. Found the student coordinators and connected on LinkedIn. 
Got quick responses from the students and evaluated 2 colleges. IIITH & IIIT-Kota.
It seems the rules are different for each IIIT. For eg: IIIT-H doesn't allow final semester
students to go off campus for internships whereas Kota does. 

I'm guessing this will be a long process of evaluating the criteria college by college and 
then setting up the dates for campus visit. It also seems like there is a lot of variation
possible in terms of how we setup the internship program. Remote vs on site. 
Full time vs part time etc. It is still not clear what the best way to go forward is. 
But, I think I will keep gathering data and interacting with students till a path
becomes clear and obvious.


### Day 2:

After discussing with a couple of friends with experience, this is what I'm going for:

Adopt a kind of guerilla hiring campaign where students will be evaluated based on their
work on a take home assignment. The things that I need to do for executing on this strategy:

1. Create an online take home assignment page
2. Create an online registration form
3. Create an online presence for the company's work.
4. Visit colleges and interact with students as a branding campaign.

There are still a couple of unanswered questions about our strategy:

1. Will part-time internships be allowed?
2. Will remote internships be allowed?

My current bias is full time remote internships is the optimal option.


### Day 3:

First step is to setup the online assignment. That's what I'll be working on today.
