title: Migrating azure deployment
---

Due to some administrative constraints, I'm having to migrate our cloud deployment across azure subscriptions.
This is a log of that effort.

## November 2

- Recieved a feasibility and cost estimate of the migration.
- Finished a call with Xencia (MS CSP). Migration seems simple and straight forward, mostly without downtime.
- Shared Global Administrator access to Xencia for both subscriptions.
- Awaiting their confirmation for timings for migration. Likely in the next 2 days.
- The migration has been scheduled for next Friday 6am.
