Feb 5 - Feb 12<br>
Week #: 6/52<br>

### Feb 6 - Monday:

Started planning for the weeks work and the valley mindset.

Fixed a couple of obvious deal breakers:

- Moved projects to _/projects_.
- Broken signup with email and password.
- Project creation happens twice.
- Added loading screen for the /projects.
- Disabled floorplan upload
- Broken auth on Firefox.

Started the week by taking a day off. I started to feel like I was inching towards burn out with little motivation or drive.
The day off breaks a 4 week steak. It did give me a chance to reflect about work. Here's some things I have realised over the past 2 days:

I have to adapt my internal sense of productivity. So far it has been about output because I had a clear goal of rewriting and releasing the product. Now that the product is out, my role will be to take feedback, identify the shortcomings and fix them. So, productivity is not the sheer amount of output. It is how efficienty I learn and adapt. I need to reflect deeper on this.

My optimal hours per week is 40. If I plan to push myself beyond that I'll fall into slow burn out. Anything over that has to happen organically without planning. I'm not sure if even that is sustainable. I may get driven by excitement over something and once that excitement is gone, I might fall into a slump breaking the core cycle. Another phenomenon to reflect and experiment on.
