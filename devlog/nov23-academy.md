title: Academy - November'23
---


Seeding the EmptyCup Academy program is the only focus for the upcoming 
November month. The objective to find atleast 4 students who will drive
the product development for EmptyCup 3D after product launch.

I'll be using this worklog as support to help me slow things down and
unpack the things in my head while I work. It will not be productivity
log. But, I'll try to use this as a grounding exercise to hedge against
me wandering off for too long.


### Day 1:

Current status:

- [The JD for the internship role is ready](https://emptycuphq.github.io/academy/internship-2023)
- The assignment page is still pending. Though the assignment itself is ready.

Next steps and todo for today:

- Create the assignment page that can be shared as a link
- Review Subham's work on the assignment
- Connect to student coordinators from 6 colleges
- Send recruitment forms to Sharang
- Create a pipeline of mentorship content for LinkedIn

I'll start with the last one (just to get me excited).

- Fleshed out the meat for LinkedIn content campaign. 
- Revied Subham's code and sent feedback.
- Finished the recruitment forms for IIIT Kota. Got stuck on IT deductions.
